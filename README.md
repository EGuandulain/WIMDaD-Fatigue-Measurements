# ELECTRIC MEASUREMENTS FOR FATIGUE TESTS

## Windmill Turbine Blades Damage Detection. (WIMDaD)

The application, developed in collaboration between TH KÃ¶ln and the Metabolon Institute, serves the purpose of measuring and analyzing the results obtained from a series of fatigue tests conducted as part of the WIMDaD project. In this project, four distinct probes undergo a cyclic load, experiencing a displacement of 20 mm in both directions. The primary objective of the measurement process is to determine the time required for each individual probe to reach its breaking point.
