# ELECTRIC MEASUREMENTS FOR FATIGUE TESTS

## Windmill Turbine Blades Damage Detection. (WIMDaD)

The application, developed in collaboration between TH KÃ¶ln and the Metabolon Institute, serves the purpose of measuring and analyzing the results obtained from a series of fatigue tests conducted as part of the WIMDaD project. In this project, four distinct probes undergo a cyclic load, experiencing a displacement of 20 mm in both directions. The primary objective of the measurement process is to determine the time required for each individual probe to reach its breaking point.


### Features of the Application

Real-Time Measurements :

Provides information about the current flowing on each of the probes.
Records the amount of time that it takes for each probe to break.
Possibility to store the measurements into CSV files for further analysis.

Results :

The Results from each tests are saved in a new dataframe and stored in a separate page.
A plot for each result can be displayed to visualize the current behavior prior the breaking point.
